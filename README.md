# Hi there!

### I am Santiago Hernández, Astrophysics student, currently finishing my Master studies in Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen. Here I share some of the projects I have developed during my free time. All related with astrophysics topics may be interesting for the curious ones and for the colleagues that went on the same journey of developing a scientific career.
